# Segment Trees

Segment Trees are data structures that let you easily find the
minimum, maximum, or sum over a given subrange of a larger range.

I've created a tutorial explaining how segment trees work and the 
process of building/updating/querying one [here](www.srcmake.com/home/segment-tree).

This repository contains a C++ class that implements a segment tree for
a minimum (Range Minimum Query) example.

Please note that I've intentionally left the code unoptimized for the 
reader to make better, as this code is meant to be easily understandable
to the viewer, not necessarily the most efficient implementation.
